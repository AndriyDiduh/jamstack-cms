# JAMstack CMS

End to end serverless blogging system. Built with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) & [AWS Amplify](https://aws-amplify.github.io/).

### Philosophy

WordPress has dominated for quite some time with estimates that it powers around 30% of all websites today. One of the reasons for the popularity of WordPress is that it is composed of all of the elements needed for such a platform, including these necessary elements:

- Authentication & authorization
- Database
- API
- Front end

While WordPress started as a blogging tool, it has evolved over the years into a powerful website builder and a robust content management system.

With updated tooling on both the front end and the back end we are starting to see the need for similar tooling in our modern stack.

JAMstack CMS fills in this gap by giving you a customizable end to end solution allowing you to get up and running with a full stack serverless website & blog with just a few commands on your command line.
